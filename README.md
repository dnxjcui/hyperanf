Implementation of the HyperANF algorithm for approximate neighborhood function calculation,
as described by algorithm 2 in the paper "HyperANF: Approximating the Neighborhood Function
of Very Large Graphs on a Budget" by Palmer et al. (2002). https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5599

This implementation uses the HyperLogLog algorithm for cardinality estimation, which is
implemented in the HLL package.
